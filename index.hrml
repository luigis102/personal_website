                <p>Luigi Alemanno is a truth seeker (not of the final truth), although he is interested in anything that involves people and nature. He is spending most of his time learning quantum physics and the ideas of the greatest thinkers of our time, Karl Popper and David Deutsch.
                    He is interested in the quantum computers field and how we will obtain the jump to universality as Alan Turing did with classical computers. 
                    Philosophical issues that he is also interested in are: 
                                                        Why are the laws of physics as they are ?
                                                        How can we describe qualia ? 
                                                        How should education in Western countries be re-built based on the great discovery of the universal explainer/constructor of David Deutsch ?
                                                        What is consciousness, and how all its different characteristics like qualia, creativity, interlocutor(s) are related ? and all the other issues about consciousness.
		I was born on 11 October 2005 and grew up in southern Italy, where I spent much of my time assisting my grandfather in his window manufacturing business. For four years, I pursued off-road cycling competitions, balancing intense training and races with work in the family business, which left little time for school. Cycling placed me in the most demanding mental and physical challenges I have ever faced, teaching me that no effort is ever truly "enough." I dedicated nearly all my time to the sport, yet I ultimately realised that a world-class career in it was not my path.
		I'm (formally) currently enrolled as a first-year physics student in the United Kingdom.
